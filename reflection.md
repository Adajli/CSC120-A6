- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I initially thought that Inheritance is the most useful method to help with programming when I initially learned it in High School, even though it was complex.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The functions and methods for House and Cafe worked out, but the function for Library did not work out initially when I tried to test it. I later on got some help from the TAs and found out what I did wrong to make the function work again. I would give advice that it is important to read through the problem, think it through carefully about useful methods, and check for requirements before solving the problem for someone taking this course in the future.
